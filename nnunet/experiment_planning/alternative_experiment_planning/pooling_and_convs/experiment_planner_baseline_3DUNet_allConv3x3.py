        Computation of input patch size starts out with the new median shape (in voxels) of a dataset. This is
        opposed to prior experiments where I based it on the median size in mm. The rationale behind this is that
        for some organ of interest the acquisition method will most likely be chosen such that the field of view and
        voxel resolution go hand in hand to show the doctor what they need to see. This assumption may be violated
        for some modalities with anisotropy (cine MRI) but we will have t live with that. In future experiments I
        will try to 1) base input patch size match aspect ratio of input size in mm (instead of voxels) and 2) to
        try to enforce that we see the same 'distance' in all directions (try to maintain equal size in mm of patch)

        The patches created here attempt keep the aspect ratio of the new_median_shape
